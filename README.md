[![PersonaPlus Readme Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=ZakaHaceCosas&repo=personaplus&theme=gotham)](https://github.com/ZakaHaceCosas/personaplus)

PersonaPlus, an app (written in React Native / Expo), designed to <i>give yourself a plus</i> as I like to say. Basically it's a selfcare app, it's meant to give you tips, create routines, etc...

It's still very VERY early and most stuff isn't even made ðŸ˜…. I'd say it's my "piloto" project.

## About me

I'm Zakaria, a  :es:Spanish UI/UX designer with over 4 years of experience, a lot of practive with HTML & CSS, now learning Lua, TypeScript, and React / React Native. Always looking for the change to make something epic!

In case you're interested (thank you btw :smile:), **yeah**, I am available for hire / commissions / whatsoever. Sometimes I don't even ask to be paid, as I'm seeking some working experience and practice.
