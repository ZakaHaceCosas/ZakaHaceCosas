# Good morning, afternoon, night, or whenever you're here.<br />I'm [Zaka](https://zakahacecosas.github.io) and I Make Stuff ;]

<!-- ## My best projects

Currently just one; more is to be placed here soon.

[![FuckingNode][card-fuckingnode]][repo-fuckingnode]

**FuckingNode** (what a name) is a CLI utility to automate a ton of annoying, repetitive tasks someone has to take care of when working with NodeJS/DenoJS/BunJS projects (dependencies, cleanup, linting, prettifying, etc...).

## About me -->

I'm Zakaria, a :es: Spanish UI/UX designer with over 5 years of experience using Figma. I also know TypeScript, and the basics of React and React Native. I'm trying to further learn those, as well as Svelte and very occasionally Lua and LuaRT.
